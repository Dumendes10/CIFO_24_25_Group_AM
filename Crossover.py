    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary mapping each player ID (int) to their position (str).

        """
        Repairs an offspring by removing duplicate players and replacing 
        them with valid players that were missing from the solution.

        This function ensures:
            - Each player appears only once across all teams.
            - Players are only replaced by others who play the same position.
            - All players from the original player pool are used exactly once.

        The function relies on two external variables:
            - `all_players`: A set of all player IDs expected to be used in the solution.
            - `position_map`: A dictionary mapping player IDs to their positions (e.g., 'GK', 'DEF').
            - `position_slots`: A list defining the position expected at each slot in a team.

        Parameters:
            offspring (list of list of int): A candidate solution represented as a list of teams, 
                                            where each team is a list of player IDs.

        Returns:
            list of list of int: A repaired version of the offspring, where:
                                - All players are unique.
                                - Each player is placed in a slot matching their position.
                                - Missing players are added in valid positions.

        Notes:
            The function modifies teams independently, attempting to replace invalid entries
            (duplicates or misplaced players) with players not yet used but suitable for
            the expected position.
